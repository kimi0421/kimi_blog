Combined, these capabilities make it faster, easier, and more cost effective to harness big data to maximum benefit for the business.\n",

Existing Big Data stacks are batch oriented. Search and analytics need to be interactive. Use machines to learn machine-generated data. And more data beats better algorithms.\n",

With H2O, you can work with your existing languages and tools. Further, you can extend the platform seamlessly into your Hadoop environments."

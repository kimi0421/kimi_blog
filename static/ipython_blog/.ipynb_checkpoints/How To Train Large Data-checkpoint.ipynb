      "When I anticipated in Kaggle display ads competition, I encountered a problem that how can I train the data that is larger than 10G. In machine learning, when we train the data we always read the training data set into memory and do optimization calculation to find the global best parameters. But what if you don't have large memory? Can we parallel the training method, even the simplest linear regression model? Can we use map-reduce method? Can we partially train the data and then average all the trained model generated? There are so many questions I have and I don't have very clear answer. I would like to do some research using python code to solve my problem. "
